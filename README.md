# hashtableWithChaining
A hashtable implementation using java which uses chaining as collision resolution,

The code for this implementaion of hashtable can be updated by creating a better hash function or improving the load factor.
The current hash function uses the default hashcode method from the java core api.

In practice, a hashtable built with support for open addressing performs better than the one backed up using chaining.
But, if we have space constraint, then chaining is preferred over open addressing.
